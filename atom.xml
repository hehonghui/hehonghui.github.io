At the end of the hike, a short drive will take us to the Watertown at the bottom of Simatai Great Wall. Check-in the comfortable traditional style room in the Watertown. In the late afternoon we could hike up the Simatai section of the Great Wall to see the sunset, if the weather and time permit, or we will stroll around the water-town with a massive backdrop of the world famous Simatai Great Wall.

The town is situated in Gubei Township of Miyun County northeast of Beijing, hence the name of Gubei Water Town. It has a charming location with a massive backdrop of the world famous Simatai Great Wall, accompany of the romantic Yuanyang Lake ( Mandarin Duck ) and the ancient Simatai Village that was developed from Simatai Castle built during the reign of Emperor Wanli ( 1573 -1620 ) in Ming Dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ). So the Gubei Water Town resort is a rare combo of Great Wall, Mountains, Lakes and Ancient Villages. After that, we will do a 3hrs round hike on the spectacular Simatai Great Wall (from No. 2 tower to No. 10 tower takes 2hrs, back to the bottom takes 1 hour). The Simatai Great Wall lies beside Gubeikou Town. The wall is celebrated for its steepness, queerness and intactness. Constructed under the supervision of Qi Jiguang, a famous general in the Ming Dynasty(1368-1644), it is the only part that still has the original appearance of the Ming Dynasty.

At the end of the hike, a short drive will take us to the Watertown at the bottom of Simatai Great Wall. Check-in the comfortable traditional style room in the Watertown. In the late afternoon we could hike up the Simatai section of the Great Wall to see the sunset, if the weather and time permit, or we will stroll around the water-town with a massive backdrop of the world famous Simatai Great Wall. Tonight you will be treated with a great dinner.</p><h4 id="Day-2-Gubei-Water-Town-Simatai-BL-6-km-2-3-hrs"><a href="#Day-2-Gubei-Water-Town-Simatai-BL-6-km-2-3-hrs" class="headerlink" title="Day 2 Gubei Water Town+ Simatai (BL; 6 km; 2-3 hrs)"></a>Day 2 Gubei Water Town+ Simatai (BL; 6 km; 2-3 hrs)</h4><p>This morning, we will have a leisure time in a newly built water town. The town is situated in Gubei Township of Miyun County northeast of Beijing, hence the name of Gubei Water Town. It has a charming location with a massive backdrop of the world famous Simatai Great Wall, accompany of the romantic Yuanyang Lake ( Mandarin Duck ) and the ancient Simatai Village that was developed from Simatai Castle built during the reign of Emperor Wanli ( 1573 -1620 ) in Ming Dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ). So the Gubei Water Town resort is a rare combo of Great Wall, Mountains, Lakes and Ancient Villages. After that, we will do a 3hrs round hike on the spectacular Simatai Great Wall (from No. 2 tower to No. 10 tower takes 2hrs, back to the bottom takes 1 hour). The Simatai Great Wall lies beside Gubeikou Town. The wall is celebrated for its steepness, queerness and intactness. Constructed under the supervision of Qi Jiguang, a famous general in the Ming Dynasty(1368-1644), it is the only part that still has the original appearance of the Ming Dynasty.
